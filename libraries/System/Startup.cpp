/*
There are two reasons that Startup has to be in asm:

1. Registers CPSR and SP are not directly available to C code.
     So, we write a crumb of inline asm to access these registers,
     then write the rest in C(++).
2. Exact control of the interrupt table is needed
     So, we use more inline asm 

Other complications: Setting up the stack before the stack is available (use naked)
                     IRQ wrapper proper return (use interrupt("IRQ"))
                     Vector table can have any name, but must be in section 
		       called .vectors so that it will link to the right place

This is tightly integrated with the linker script [lo|hi]mem_arm_eabi_cpp.ld and
depends on certain symbols there with the correct name and correct location.

//Generally sections are delimited by start and end symbols, which can be subtracted
//to get the size of the section. The start symbol is perfectly usable as an
//array, and the end symbol, while never used directly, is the same array type as
//the start symbol so that their pointers are compatible.
//All of these symbols are created by the linker, and their names are controlled
