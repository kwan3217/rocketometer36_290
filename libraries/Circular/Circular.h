//Circular buffer with attempt at atomic message write
//The buffer consists of a block of memory which conceptually contains
//two parts - data which is ready to be flushed, and data which is not
//yet ready. The buffer writer decides when the data which wasn't ready
//becomes so, and when it is, it is added to the data which is ready.
//The buffer gets written to by the generic fill() function. 
//A special drain() function empties data out of the buffer somehow and
//moves the head ptr up.
//All circular buffers are 1024 characters.
